This TriviaGame was created using jQuery. 

The meat of this project was the jQuery hide/show/toggle functions. These allowed me to create all the content in the HTML file and just show certain parts of it when necessary. It is relatively basic. I started creating a version that was much more complicated and dynamic, but settled on this structure due to the simplicity. 

Thanks for playing!
